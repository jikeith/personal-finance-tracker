Problem Statement
Young adults often struggle to track their spending habits effectively, leading to overspending and poor financial decisions. Many existing personal finance apps are overly complex or lack personalization, which discourages consistent use.  A good amount of young adults experience difficulty managing their finances myself included, resulting in an average of $500 in monthly overspending. Therefore a need for a simplified and personalized solution that encourages consistent financial awareness and helps users make informed decisions is needed.
